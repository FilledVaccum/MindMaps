
My personal collection of technical diagrams and mind maps. I created these while studying for interviews and learning new technologies. Thought they might be useful for others too.

## What's in here

I've been making these diagrams to help me understand complex topics better. There are about 50+ mind maps covering:

- **Cloud stuff** (AWS, Azure, GCP) - Services I've worked with or needed to learn
- **System Design** - Interview prep mostly, plus some real architectures I've encountered
- **Machine Learning** - Recent deep dive into LLMs and generative AI
- **DevOps** - Basic concepts I picked up along the way
- **Data Analytics** - Google Analytics course notes

## How I organize things

```
├── Cloud/           # Each major cloud provider
├── System Design/   # Interview prep + real examples
├── MachineLearning/ # Mostly LLM stuff lately
├── DevOps/          # Still learning this
└── Data Analytics/  # Course materials
```

## Why I made this

Honestly, I learn better with visual diagrams than reading documentation. Started making these for myself, then figured others might find them helpful. Some are more polished than others - the AWS ones are pretty detailed since I use that daily, while GCP is more basic since I'm just getting started there.

## What you'll find

Most diagrams are made in draw.io because it's free and works well. Some key ones:

## Some interesting ones are from distributed computing :

**Cloud:**
- AWS services I actually use (SQS, Lambda, BedRock for the AI stuff)
- Azure deep dive (had to learn this for work)
- GCP Kubernetes (still figuring this out)

**System Design:**
- Standard interview topics (CDN, caching, databases)
- Real examples like YouTube architecture
- Distributed systems concepts that took me forever to understand

**Machine Learning:**
- Transformers architecture (this one took weeks to get right)
- LLM fine-tuning process
- Linear algebra refresher (because I forgot most of it)

## How to use these

1. Clone the repo
2. Open .drawio files in [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
3. Some have .svg exports if you just want to view them

The diagrams aren't perfect - I'm still learning and updating them as I understand things better. Feel free to suggest improvements or point out mistakes.

## A few notes

- Some diagrams are more complete than others
- I tend to focus on things I'm currently working with
- The ML section got a lot of attention recently because of the AI boom
- System design ones were mostly for interview prep but turned out useful at work too

## Contributing

If you spot errors or want to add something, go for it. I'm always learning and these diagrams help me remember complex concepts better than text notes.

## Tools

Just draw.io really. Sometimes I export to SVG for presentations or sharing.

Hope these help someone else learn this stuff. Making visual diagrams has definitely helped me understand and remember technical concepts better than just reading about them.
